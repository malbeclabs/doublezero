[toolchain]
# The host toolchain must be >= 1.85.0 to parse edition2024 manifests in
# transitive deps (e.g. base64ct 1.8.3 pulled in by solana-secp256k1-recover).
# cargo build-sbf uses its own bundled Rust (platform-tools v1.51, rustc 1.84.1)
# for the actual SBF bytecode compilation regardless of the host toolchain.
