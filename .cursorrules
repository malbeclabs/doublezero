# DoubleZero Workspace Rules

## Linting
- Use `make go-lint` to run Go linters (golangci-lint)

## Code Style
- Follow the existing code style in each file
- The project uses golangci-lint with custom rules (see `.golangci.yaml`)
- Note: golangci-lint has a rewrite rule that converts `interface{}` to `any`

## Grafana dashboards

- After updating dashboards JSON in lake/grafana/dashboards, always run `docker compose restart grafana` from the `./lake` directory.
