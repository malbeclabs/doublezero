# DoubleZero Client

This directory contains the client used for connecting to the DoubleZero network. The client contains two components: a daemon which handles the establishment of tunnels into DoubleZero and a CLI for establishing smartcontracts and interacting with the local daemon. 

For details on how to connect, see the documentation [here](https://docs.malbeclabs.com/).
