# DoubleZero Workspace Rules

## Linting
- Use `make go-lint` to run Go linters (golangci-lint)

## Code Style
- Follow the existing code style in each file
- The project uses golangci-lint with custom rules (see `.golangci.yaml`)
- Note: golangci-lint has a rewrite rule that converts `interface{}` to `any`
