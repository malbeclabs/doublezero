# Smart Contract on Solana

This repository contains a smart contract written for the Solana blockchain. The smart contract is the **core permissionless component** that defines and manages the **logical layer** of the **DoubleZero** network. It allows both contributors and users to interact seamlesslyâ€”contributors can create and configure services, while users can connect to access and use them.

By establishing accounts linked to each component, the smart contract **store** the necessary parameters, enabling client controllers and services to provision **network functions** and **network features** such as **deduplication, signature verification, and other**. This ensures a decentralized, automated, and efficient approach to network service management.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Rust installed on your machine. You can download it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
- Solana CLI installed. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools) to install it.
- Node.js and npm installed. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Build the smart contract:
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

## Deployment

To deploy the smart contract to the Solana blockchain, follow these steps:

1. Set up your Solana CLI configuration:
    ```sh
    solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
    ```

2. Generate a new keypair to pay gas fees (or use an existing one):
    ```sh
    solana-keygen new --outfile /path/to/my-payer-keypair.json
    ```

3. Airdrop some SOL to your payer account if needed:
    ```sh
    solana airdrop 2 ~/my-keypair.json
    ```

4. Generate a new keypair to deploy the program (or use an existing one): 
    ```sh
    solana-keygen new --outfile /path/to/my-deployer-keypair.json
    ```

5. Build the smart contract:
    ```sh
    cargo build-sbf --manifest-path smartcontract/programs/dz-sla-program/Cargo.toml
    ```

6. Deploy the smart contract:
    Save the program ID displayed by this command for future reference.
    ```sh
    solana program deploy --fee-payer /path/to/my-payer-keypair.json -k /path/to/my-deployer-keypair.json ./smartcontract/programs/dz-sla-program/target/deploy/double_zero_sla_program.so
    ```

7. Initialize the smart contract using the program ID output by step 6:
    ```sh
    target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/doublezero --program-id <Program ID> init 
    ```
GlobalConfig: GlobalState { account_type: GlobalState, account_index: 0, foundation_allowlist: [DZfHfcCXTLwgZeCRKQ1FL1UuwAwFAZM93g86NMYpfYan], device_allowlist: [DZfHfcCXTLwgZeCRKQ1FL1UuwAwFAZM93g86NMYpfYan], user_allowlist: [DZfHfcCXTLwgZeCRKQ1FL1UuwAwFAZM93g86NMYpfYan] }
    ```

## Usage

To interact with the deployed smart contract, you can use the provided scripts or write your own. Here is an example of how to call a function from the smart contract:

```sh
solana program invoke --program-id <PROGRAM_ID> --keypair ~/my-keypair.json --data <DATA>
```
